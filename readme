# E-Commerce Mobile App UI

A modern e-commerce mobile app UI built with **React Native**, **Expo Router**, and **NativeWind**. Features include splash screens, sign-in/sign-up flows, a home screen with a fuzzy search algorithm, product listing, product details, and a cart screen. Navigation is handled via Expo Router's file-based routing, and styling is done with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS).

- **Assets**: Splash screens in the `images` folder
- **No Authentication**: Navigation-only flows for SignIn/SignUp
